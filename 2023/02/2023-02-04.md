# Byte Swap

One of the more annoying things about programming back in the day was byte swapping, when moving binary data from e.g. SGI / Sun over to Alpha or x86. Today this is rarely a problem (everything is little endian) but right now I have a need to make the byte order consistent...

Why do I care/

```
small ---------------------->big
76543210765432107654321076543210
big <---
-->small
```

Within the byte the bits are big endian, but between bytes they are little endian. This means if I am using the bits to update e.g. a display (which I am) I need to shuffle them to make sense in the output. This is annoying.

The use case is also to make this _fast_ to work within the parameters of the task.

Tested:

- viper with manual byte wrangling
- pack and unpack with `struct`
- assembly

As:

```python
import struct

@micropython.viper
def byteswap(a: uint) -> uint:
    return ((uint(0xff000000) & a) >> 24) | \
           ((uint(0x00ff0000) & a) >> 8) | \
           ((uint(0x0000ff00) & a) << 8) | \
           ((uint(0x000000ff) & a) << 24)

@micropython.asm_thumb
def byteswap_asm(r0):
    # const for masking
    mov(r6, 0xff)
    
    # save input
    mov(r7, r0)
    
    # byte 3
    mov(r1, r7)
    mov(r5, 24)
    lsr(r1, r5)
    and_(r1, r6)
    mov(r0, r1)
    
    # byte 2
    mov(r1, r7)
    mov(r5, 16)
    lsr(r1, r5)
    and_(r1, r6)
    mov(r5, 8)
    lsl(r1, r5)
    orr(r0, r1)

    # byte 1
    mov(r1, r7)
    mov(r5, 8)
    lsr(r1, r5)
    and_(r1, r6)
    mov(r5, 16)
    lsl(r1, r5)
    orr(r0, r1)

    # byte 0
    mov(r1, r7)
    and_(r1, r6)
    mov(r5, 24)
    lsl(r1, r5)
    orr(r0, r1)

@micropython.viper
def byteswap_struct(a: uint) -> uint:
    b = struct.pack("<I", a)
    return uint(struct.unpack(">I", b)[0])

x = 0x11223344
print(hex(x), hex(byteswap(x)), hex(byteswap_asm(x)), hex(byteswap_struct(x)))
```

Turns out the viper'd Python with bit shifts and the assembly are fairly comparable - allowing for the fact that there is a non-trivial overhead in any ÂµPython function call. The `struct` version? Sucks. Also non viper'd bit shifting...

![Times for 20 calls](./byteswap-times.png)

Here we have the time for a `nop()` type call (red, brown, orange) and the times for assembly (green), viper'd bit shifts (blue) and `struct` (purple). If I could call `rev` in the assembly that would probably be super fast but that is not included in the ÂµPython `asm_thumb` interface ðŸ˜ž.
