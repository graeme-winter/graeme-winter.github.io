# CircuitPython / uctypes

After enabling `uctypes`, wanted to see how it works in place if `mem32` - it turns out quite well, though could get expensive memory wise with lots of spare dictionaries lying around.

## Task

Reproduce the clock wrangling on ItsyBitsy M4 to write out 1kHz square wave to D13. Before, with MicroPython, achieved this [with a lot of mem32 calls](../04/2023-04-16.md) to set up the GCLK, MCLK, PORT and so on. Here do the same, building structures from the data sheet to facilitate.

## Code

```python
import uctypes

PORT = {
    "DIR": 0x0 | uctypes.UINT32,
    "DIRCLR": 0x4 | uctypes.UINT32,
    "DIRSET": 0x8 | uctypes.UINT32,
    "DIRTGL": 0xC | uctypes.UINT32,
    "OUT": 0x10 | uctypes.UINT32,
    "OUTCLR": 0x14 | uctypes.UINT32,
    "OUTSET": 0x18 | uctypes.UINT32,
    "OUTTGL": 0x1C | uctypes.UINT32,
    "IN": 0x20 | uctypes.UINT32,
    "CTRL": 0x24 | uctypes.UINT32,
    "PMUX": (0x30 | uctypes.ARRAY, 16 | uctypes.UINT8),
    "PINCFG": (0x40 | uctypes.ARRAY, 32 | uctypes.UINT8),
}

GCLK = {
    "GENCTRL": (0x20 | uctypes.ARRAY, 12 | uctypes.UINT32),
    "PCHCTRL": (0x80 | uctypes.ARRAY, 48 | uctypes.UINT32),
}

MCLK = {"APBBMASK": 0x18 | uctypes.UINT32}

TCC1 = {
    "CTRLA": 0x0 | uctypes.UINT32,
    "WAVE": 0x3C | uctypes.UINT32,
    "PER": 0x40 | uctypes.UINT32,
    "CC2": 0x4C | uctypes.UINT32,
}

port = uctypes.struct(0x41008000, PORT, uctypes.LITTLE_ENDIAN)
gclk = uctypes.struct(0x40001C00, GCLK, uctypes.LITTLE_ENDIAN)
mclk = uctypes.struct(0x40000800, MCLK, uctypes.LITTLE_ENDIAN)
tcc1 = uctypes.struct(0x41018000, TCC1, uctypes.LITTLE_ENDIAN)

port.PINCFG[22] |= 1
port.PMUX[11] |= 5

gclk.GENCTRL[4] = (0x1 << 16) | (0x1 << 8) | 0x7
gclk.PCHCTRL[25] = (0x1 << 6) | 0x4

mclk.APBBMASK |= 0x1 << 12

tcc1.WAVE = 2
tcc1.PER = 119999
tcc1.CC2 = 60000
tcc1.CTRLA = 2
```

Sets up struct (not quite minimal, not complete either ðŸ™„) for the main peripherals I want to poke at, then pretty much as before configures them. Output on 'scope is indeed ~ 1kHz square wave (approximate, because no crystal).

`uctypes` is a valid replacement, no need really for mem32. Could use this to also cast data from e.g. `bytearray` to other data types => probably useful.
