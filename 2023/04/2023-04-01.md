# Assembly for Mandelbrot sets

For me this is pretty well warn ground - calculating a Mandelbrot set using ARM assembly. Right now though this will try doing so _from Python_ which may strike as absurd. Because it is. The µPython I use for this kind of thing has the concept of a decorator for `asm_thumb` and an inline assembler. You can use this to implement Python functions in assembly (at least, the Thumb subset). The only issue is that the wrappers include a minimal subset of such instructions, so much of it you need to roll for youself by putting the right numbers in the right places.

Much time has been spent in [DDI0308](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0308/latest/) - the ARM Architecture Reference Manual Thumb2 supplement - a catchy title for a real page turner.

One difficulty with this is having enough space to store / transmit the image. The calculation here is therefore performed in scan lines, with each scan line written to memory then transmitted to a host computer over UART.

## The Code

Where possible this uses the `asm_thumb` standard wrapper functions - however these are limited in that they can only access `r0-r7` and don't include a number of the functions I would assume are critical. N.B, you also _cannot_ mix in standard 32 bit ARMv7 instructions.

With no shortage of irony the code below is written _for clarity_ in that the binary instructions are separated out into the groups used in the data sheet, so e.g. the register value will look like `_0001_` for `r1`. In most (if not all?) cases the instructions are prefixed with the assembly mnemonic and the § number in the reference manual. It is worth noting also that though extensive use is made below of `imm12` value encoding, I still have no idea how it works.

## Result and Discussion

It took around 500s to execute the program above - which feels like an age of mankind. However, it works correctly:

![Mandelbrot set](./mandel.png)

(more usefully, it gives bitwise identical results to another implementation). Interestingly, this takes around 50s to execute in traditional ARM assembly on a Raspberry Pi 0, at 1GHz. These are relatively comparable as both ARMv7 based devices, so within 20% or so feels fairly respectable, given the inevitable overhead of including Python (and having to JIT assemble, which comes out of the execution time.)
