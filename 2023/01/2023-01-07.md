# µPython access to bytes in RAM

To do anything non-trivial needs DMA, which is work in progress, but had a quick moment at accessing RAM from µPython and turns out to be pretty easy...

```python
from uctypes import addressof
from machine import mem16
from array import array

# initialise array
scratch = array("H", [0xffff for _ in range(1024)])

# grab address and overwrite
address = addressof(scratch)

for j in range(0, 2048, 2):
    mem16[address + j] = j // 2

for j, s in enumerate(scratch):
    assert j == s
```

Useful if you are driving stuff from e.g. ADC to DMA by writing the right registers...
