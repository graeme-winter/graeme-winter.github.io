# ¬µPython access to bytes in RAM

## RAM access by pointer

To do anything non-trivial needs DMA, which is work in progress, but had a quick moment at accessing RAM from ¬µPython and turns out to be pretty easy...

```python
from uctypes import addressof
from machine import mem16
from array import array

# initialise array
scratch = array("H", [0xffff for _ in range(1024)])

# grab address and overwrite
address = addressof(scratch)

for j in range(0, 2048, 2):
    mem16[address + j] = j // 2

for j, s in enumerate(scratch):
    assert j == s
```

## ADC

Useful if you are driving stuff from e.g. ADC to DMA by writing the right registers... driving the ADC for one shot is at least relatively simple:

```python
from machine import mem32

# prepare the pin (set the function to NULL which is 0b11111, needed for ADC)
IO_BANK_BASE = 0x40014000
GPIO26_CTRL = IO_BANK_BASE + 0xD4
mem32[GPIO26_CTRL] = 0b11111

# configure the ADC inc. FIFO - registers
ADC_BASE = 0x4004C000
ADC_CS = ADC_BASE + 0x0
ADC_RESULT = ADC_BASE + 0x4

# trigger ADC for one read
mem32[ADC_CS] = 0x4 + 0x1

# read value
result = mem32[ADC_RESULT]

# report the value remembering that the range is 12 but not 16
print(result)
```

## DMA

Now this is where things get a whole bunch more involved. Much more involved: FIFO control and status register, enabling DREQ for DMA, not chaining (because I don't want to go that fast) and setting up a scratch array to copy the data into.

Job list:

- data array with pointer
- set up ADC in free running mode with FIFO
- set up DMA from ADC FIFO to data array
- trigger ADC
- wait for DMA to be happy that it has moved enough words
- disable ADC

I think that _should_ be enough...

### Data array and pointer

Easy -> as above, has to be type `uint16_t` also known as "H" in ¬µPython. Just make sure that this is allocated to be sufficiently large for however many measurements I will need. Looks like using ~ 100kB will be fine as `gc.mem_free()` shows about 170kB.

### ADC in free running mode

Register pointers:

```python
# configure the ADC inc. FIFO - registers
ADC_BASE = 0x4004c000
ADC_CS = ADC_BASE + 0x0
ADC_FCS = ADC_BASE + 0x8
ADC_FIFO = ADC_BASE + 0xC
```

N.B. for this using `DREQ` not `IRQ` so want to operate in "quiet" mode. The ADC DREQ value is `0x24`. Need to set the FIFO threshold to 1, enable the DREQ, enable the FIFO. ADC `CS` register needs to be set to 9: `START_MANY|EN`. Set up the DMA to read from the `ADC_FIFO` address.

### DMA

Should really do something simple with this first like using DMA to fill an array with a specific byte pattern from a single word -> do that next. Setting that up _should_ be simple and equivalent and ... easy to debug. No `DREQ` as will be as fast as possible => `0x3f`. `INCR_WRITE` üëç but `INCR_READ` üëé.

```python
from machine import mem32
from uctypes import addressof
from array import array

COUNT = 1024

target = array("H", [0 for j in range(COUNT)])
source = array("H", [0xFFFF])

print(addressof(target), addressof(source))

# DMA registers
DMA_BASE = 0x50000000
CH0_READ_ADDR = DMA_BASE + 0x0
CH0_WRITE_ADDR = DMA_BASE + 0x4
CH0_TRANS_COUNT = DMA_BASE + 0x8
CH0_CTRL_TRIG = DMA_BASE + 0xC

QUIET = 0x1 << 21
DREQ = 0x3F << 15
WRITE_INCR = 0x1 << 5
DATA_SIZE = 0x1 << 2
ENABLE = 1

mem32[CH0_READ_ADDR] = addressof(source)
mem32[CH0_WRITE_ADDR] = addressof(target)
mem32[CH0_TRANS_COUNT] = COUNT
mem32[CH0_CTRL_TRIG] = QUIET + DREQ + WRITE_INCR + DATA_SIZE + ENABLE

BUSY = 0x1 << 24

while mem32[CH0_CTRL_TRIG] & BUSY:
    continue

for t in target:
    print(t)
```

That seems easy enough (prints lots of 65535).
