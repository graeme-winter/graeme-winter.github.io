# UART day 2

Moving data over UART on one rp2040 is fine but you need to be able to read and write more than one FIFO (the FIFOs are quite big...) so thread time:

```python
from machine import UART, Pin
import _thread
import time

uart0 = UART(0, baudrate=115200, tx=Pin(0), rx=Pin(1))
uart1 = UART(1, baudrate=115200, tx=Pin(8), rx=Pin(9))

tx = bytearray(1000)

for j in range(1000):
    tx[j] = j % 250

rx = bytearray(1000)

nn = 0


def reader(buffer):
    global nn
    nn = None
    while nn is None:
        nn = uart0.readinto(buffer)
    print("Done reading:", nn)


_thread.start_new_thread(reader, (rx,))
nw = uart1.write(tx)
print("Done writing:", nw)

time.sleep(0.1)

assert nn == 1000

for j in range(1000):
    assert tx[j] == rx[j]
```

This would be much neater with chained UARTS and so on.
