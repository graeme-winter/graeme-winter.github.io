# µPython for real time

Decided I should see what you can do with µPython and real-time programming on the PIO... turns out it works fine but obviously only useful for _very limited_ values of real-time.

Implemented simple time counter on PIO: wait until high, start, while high decrement, return once falls to low: takes two instructions / cycle so 16ns with default config, confirmed [yesterday](./2023-01-02.md) on oscilloscope.

[Example code](https://github.com/graeme-winter/rp2040-explore/tree/main/%C2%B5Python-real-time) for this (other programs will appear): todo assess how "noisy" a busy loop with `sleep()` is...
