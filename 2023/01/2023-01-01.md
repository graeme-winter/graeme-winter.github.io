Make a vague effort to improve knowledge more frequently. Today trying to start estimating rp2040 IRQ response times. Start by using `time_us_32()` as a simple time counter (in µs obviously) and hook up one GPIO as output to one as input, start the timer then raise output, count time until IRQ fired...

This seems to count ~ 425µs (+/- 1) which seems like a _very long time_ so may need to look at what is happening here...

OK, still clocks 425µs when I unplug the link wire -> something not right here.
