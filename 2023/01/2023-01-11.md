# PIO for DAC driving

Driving a DAC with a PIO is well established technology in C: the [pico signal generator](https://github.com/graeme-winter/pico-signal-generator) does exactly this and will be revisited from ÂµPython later. Meanwhile however the question arises of how to send the symbols for a 6-bit DAC from the PIO without messing around with DMA right now.

PIO is good for up to 5 bit numbers because of the structure of the assembly. Simply counting down from 31 is therefore a good way of driving five of the bits, and the sixth can be done by side-set e.g.

```python
from machine import Pin
from rp2 import PIO, StateMachine, asm_pio

# use pin0 as sideset, 1...5 as "data"
pins = [Pin(j) for j in range(6)]


@asm_pio(
    sideset_init=PIO.OUT_LOW,
    out_init=(PIO.OUT_LOW, PIO.OUT_LOW, PIO.OUT_LOW, PIO.OUT_LOW, PIO.OUT_LOW),
    out_shiftdir=PIO.SHIFT_RIGHT,
)
def saw():
    wrap_target()
    set(x, 31)
    label("tick")
    mov(osr, x)
    out(pins, 5).side(1)
    nop()
    nop().side(0)
    jmp(x_dec, "tick")
    wrap()


sm = StateMachine(0, saw, freq=12500, sideset_base=pins[0], out_base=pins[1])
sm.active(1)
```

This is fine but the timing needs some work, as each of the symbols from `0b111111` to `0b000000` are visited but not for the same amount of time. Running with just four bits (so 16 symbols) with

```python
from machine import Pin
from rp2 import PIO, StateMachine, asm_pio

# use pin0 as sideset, 1...5 as "data"
pins = [Pin(j) for j in range(6)]
for p in pins:
    p.off()


@asm_pio(
    sideset_init=PIO.OUT_LOW,
    out_init=(PIO.OUT_LOW, PIO.OUT_LOW, PIO.OUT_LOW),
    out_shiftdir=PIO.SHIFT_RIGHT,
)
def saw():
    wrap_target()
    set(x, 31)
    label("tick")
    mov(osr, x)
    out(pins, 5).side(1)
    nop()[1]
    nop().side(0)
    jmp(x_dec, "tick")
    wrap()


sm = StateMachine(0, saw, freq=12500, sideset_base=pins[2], out_base=pins[3])
sm.active(1)
```

Showed where the extra no-op was needed to balance the counting... at least it appears to be so: the scope _did_ seem to show some timing jitter which is odd...

To do this better will involve using a _second_ PIO program to read from the pins and send the symbols back out to main memory for manual inspection -> DMA time... done. With a little revision and some careful debugging have a second state machine triggered at the same instant counting back - which works fine but is somewhat limited as the `set x 31` command it opens with causes an extra zero-count...

```python
from machine import Pin, mem32
from rp2 import PIO, StateMachine, asm_pio
from uctypes import addressof

# state maachine allocation (both on PIO0)
# machine 0 -> signal generator
# machine 1 -> signal reader

# useful DREQ definition
DREQ_PIO0_RX1 = 5

# register definitions
PIO0_BASE = 0x50200000
PIO0_CTRL = PIO0_BASE + 0x0
PIO0_FSTAT = PIO0_BASE + 0x4
PIO0_RXF1 = PIO0_BASE + 0x24

# DMA registers
DMA_BASE = 0x50000000
CH0_READ_ADDR = DMA_BASE + 0x0
CH0_WRITE_ADDR = DMA_BASE + 0x4
CH0_TRANS_COUNT = DMA_BASE + 0x8
CH0_CTRL_TRIG = DMA_BASE + 0xC

# use pin0 as sideset, 1...5 as "data"
pins = [Pin(j) for j in range(6)]


@asm_pio(
    sideset_init=PIO.OUT_LOW,
    out_init=(PIO.OUT_LOW, PIO.OUT_LOW, PIO.OUT_LOW, PIO.OUT_LOW, PIO.OUT_LOW),
    out_shiftdir=PIO.SHIFT_RIGHT,
)
def saw():
    wrap_target()
    set(x, 31)
    label("tick")
    mov(osr, x)
    out(pins, 5).side(1)
    nop()
    nop().side(0)
    jmp(x_dec, "tick")
    wrap()


# auto-push / push on 32 bits to FIFO / join FIFOs
@asm_pio(
    autopush=True, push_thresh=32, in_shiftdir=PIO.SHIFT_RIGHT, fifo_join=PIO.JOIN_RX
)
def eight_bits_in():
    wrap_target()
    in_(pins, 8)
    wrap()


# set up scratch array to copy results to
COUNT = 256
scratch = bytearray(COUNT)

# set up DMA from PIO ISR
QUIET = 0x1 << 21
DREQ = DREQ_PIO0_RX1 << 15
WRITE_INCR = 0x1 << 5
DATA_SIZE = 0x2 << 2
ENABLE = 0x1

# clear FIFO
while not (mem32[PIO0_FSTAT] & (1 << 9)):
    _ = mem32[PIO0_RXF1]

mem32[CH0_READ_ADDR] = PIO0_RXF1
mem32[CH0_WRITE_ADDR] = addressof(scratch)
mem32[CH0_TRANS_COUNT] = COUNT // 4
mem32[CH0_CTRL_TRIG] = QUIET + DREQ + WRITE_INCR + DATA_SIZE + ENABLE

# trigger DMA on DREQ from PIO (1 word depth trigger)
# read bytes for as long as needed (should be multiple of 4)
tick = StateMachine(0, saw, freq=12500, sideset_base=pins[0], out_base=pins[1])

# this is reading eight pins not 6 bit I think that doesn't matter as all pins
# are wired for input
bits = StateMachine(1, eight_bits_in, freq=12500, in_base=pins[0])

# FIXME I should probably reset the clocks here

# activate
mem32[PIO0_CTRL] = 0x3

# wait for DMA completion
BUSY = 0x1 << 24

while mem32[CH0_CTRL_TRIG] & BUSY:
    continue

# stop
mem32[PIO0_CTRL] = 0

for j in range(COUNT):
    print(scratch[j])
```

Nice example though: should set a second DMA feeding bytes _in_ so we can completely go around the loop. More interesting would be go hook up a second pico to the first with a clock on a side-set so we can see how fast we can read across 8 x 150mm jumpers. All symbols were in the output 3 times except for zero which was there for four.
