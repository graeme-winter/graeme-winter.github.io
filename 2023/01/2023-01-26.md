# Practical example #2: DMA signal generator

Already implemented in C in the pico-signal-generator but now I know about driving the DMA etc. from µPython it feels like something I should be able to do more flexibly. Spoiler: it works fine, just takes some careful thinking.

## Wiring

Wire up an 8-bit resistor DAC, off pins 0...7 of the pico. If fewer than 8 bits ensure that the most significant bits are taken (e.g. 2...7 if 6 bit).

## Software

Here we are using the PIO to push 8 bits / cycle to the GPIO: to pace this use the DREQ for the PIO TX buffer (and join buffers, not sure how critical that is for 8 bits / cycle). Also run at much less than 125MHz for useful test coverage for ADC reading (though will assess how well it works at full clock speed.)

PIO program is trivial: `out pins 8` with some supporting infrastructure (autopull on 32 bit boundary, right shift etc.) - the DMA electronics are doing the heavy lifting here. Setting up the signal buffer is also relatively simple: 100,000 byte buffer of 8 bit samples, in the example configured as 1,000 samples / cycle copied 100 times. The DMA is slightly more complex as we have channels 0, 1 working as a tag team, each triggering the other at the end of the cycle so we need a µPython loop to keep these topped up, reconfiguring the channels once they are finished. That could and should be moved to a separate thread so the main loop can update the signal buffer.

## Code

100+ lines of nonsense pseudo-µPython:

```python
# sine wave data source -> generate 100,000 point sine wave buffer
# and then push this out through pio0 at 100kHz -> divider of
# 1250 etc.

```

But it gets the job done.

## Results

More jitter on the frequency than I would expect but overall works well:

Some debugging could be useful but on balance happy with that. Update: seems to work fine with 125,000 elements in data array and outputting at 125MHz -> reloading the buffer every 1ms:
