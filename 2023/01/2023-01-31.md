# Analogue is Hard

So, have the R2R ladder resistor DAC as one option for analogue output, but that is annoying to make as it turns out to be very sensitive to the precise resistance of components and my resistors are ... cheap. So try another option: PWM + two stage low pass filter:

![Circuit diagram for low pass filter](./low-pass.png)

Actually they were 2.2nF capacitors but that rounds to a nonsense value on the web page which generates the diagram. This is timed so that RC ~ 2ms i.e. suitable for 500kHz use: by a happy accident what you would get with a PWM counting to 250 (i.e. about 8 bits) at 125MHz.

## Code

This one is easy and recycles old register bashing code: start a PWM with a count-to of 249 (i.e. counts 0...249 inclusive) and then use DMA to push the compare value in on every PWM wrap. The register used for this maps to A and B -> need a 32 bit value with only lower 8 bits set which is annoying. Other than that, almost the same as the code from the [signal generator before](./2023-01-27.md).

## Results

The results are a little messy because we are running the signal through a low pass filter which will also retard the pulses, though given the comparison between the PWM time (2Âµs) and signal frequency (1ms) we can kinda ignore that. 50% constant duty shows some ripple:

![Scope trace with ripple](./F0010TEK.png)

This will be impossible to avoid in the long game and replaces the LSB limits in the R2R DAC. Since wave comes through OK:

![PWM sine wave at 1kHz](./PWM-SINE.png)

Will be interesting to compare this with the R2R version.
