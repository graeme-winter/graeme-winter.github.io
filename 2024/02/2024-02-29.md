# PIO debugging (less trivial)

A less trivial example for the PIO debugging: the interaction between a pair of state machines, which between them are implementing advancing and retarding the A, B signal combinations for a quadrature encoder: this shows tracking the behaviour of a pair of state machines working together.

This is a key part of the test program for the pico-panda implementation project - driving a quadrature input with deterministic behaviour is critical for this.

## PIO programs

The first part of this is the basic quadrature signal generator:

```python
from machine import Pin, mem32
import rp2


# quadrature sequence generators: working in multiples of 4 such that a 
# full sequence returns to the original state: incr and decr functions:
# sm.put(NN//4) to increment by NN counts

@rp2.asm_pio(set_init=(rp2.PIO.OUT_LOW, rp2.PIO.OUT_LOW))
def incr():
    wrap_target()
    pull()
    mov(x, osr)
    label("start")
    set(pins, 1)[1]
    set(pins, 3)[1]
    set(pins, 2)[1]
    set(pins, 0)
    jmp(x_dec, "start")
    mov(isr, invert(x))
    push()
    wrap()


@rp2.asm_pio(set_init=(rp2.PIO.OUT_LOW, rp2.PIO.OUT_LOW))
def decr():
    wrap_target()
    pull()
    mov(x, osr)
    label("start")
    set(pins, 2)[1]
    set(pins, 3)[1]
    set(pins, 1)[1]
    set(pins, 0)
    jmp(x_dec, "start")
    mov(isr, invert(x))
    push()
    wrap()


# generate 4 x OUT pins though only two are used at the moment for the
# quadrature output
pins = [Pin(j, Pin.OUT) for j in range(4)]

# PIO1 blocks for signal generation: using SM 4, 5 i.e. PIO1 SM 0, 1
sm4 = rp2.StateMachine(4, incr, freq=62_500_000, set_base=pins[0])
sm5 = rp2.StateMachine(5, decr, freq=62_500_000, set_base=pins[0])
```

At this point you would usually just enable sm4, or sm5, then `put` values in for the number of counts. In the case of debugging however we don't enable, just step through from assembly code which enables and disables with a two tick delay between one and the next: N.B. clock divider set to two above by using `freq=62_500_000`.

```python
from disasm import disasm


PIO0_BASE = 0x50200000
PIO1_BASE = 0x50300000


# advance one or more PIO SMs on PIO block pointed at by r0 masked by r1
# call with e.g. advance(PIO1_BASE, 0x3) to advance SM 4, 5 by one tick
@micropython.asm_thumb
def advance(r0, r1):
    mov(r2, 0)
    str(r1, [r0, 0])
    str(r2, [r0, 0])
    mov(r0, 0)


# incr and decr by m counts n times
@micropython.native
def updown(n, m):
    for j in range(n):
        sm4.put((m // 4) - 1)
        sm4.active(1)
        sm4.get()
        sm4.active(0)
        sm5.put((m // 4) - 1)
        sm5.active(1)
        sm5.get()
        sm5.active(0)


# simply increment by m counts
@micropython.native
def up(m):
    sm4.put((m // 4) - 1)
    sm4.active(1)
    sm4.get()
    sm4.active(0)


# simply decrement by m counts
@micropython.native
def down(m):
    sm5.put((m // 4) - 1)
    sm5.active(1)
    sm5.get()
    sm5.active(0)


# example case: incremenet by 8 counts (i.e. two full cycles) on SM4
# then decrement by the same number on SM5, printing the instructions
# being executed on every step

NN = 8
k = 0

sm4.put((NN // 4) - 1)
for j in range(2 * NN + 4):
    k += 1
    print(
        "%04x %20s %20s"
        % (
            k,
            " ".join(disasm(mem32[PIO1_BASE | 0xD8], 0, False)),
            " ".join(disasm(mem32[PIO1_BASE | 0xF0], 0, False)),
        )
    )
    advance(PIO1_BASE, 0x3)
sm4.get()

sm5.put((NN // 4) - 1)
for j in range(2 * NN + 4):
    k += 1
    print(
        "%04x %20s %20s"
        % (
            k,
            " ".join(disasm(mem32[PIO1_BASE | 0xD8], 0, False)),
            " ".join(disasm(mem32[PIO1_BASE | 0xF0], 0, False)),
        )
    )
    advance(PIO1_BASE, 0x3)
sm5.get()

# to show we are ended print the current SM instructions: both are
# stuck on pull block so we are waiting for > 1 sm.put() instructions
# from the calling routine

k += 1
print(
    "%04x %20s %20s"
    % (
        k,
        " ".join(disasm(mem32[PIO1_BASE | 0xD8], 0, False)),
        " ".join(disasm(mem32[PIO1_BASE | 0xF0], 0, False)),
    )
)
advance(PIO1_BASE, 0x3)
```

This will show precisely the timing that the PIO units are taking to perform the tasks:

If this was run at the usual clock speed this would take 464ns to run with a clock divider of 2, which would be impossible to watch.

## Quadrature

The goal of some of this work is to implement a quadrature encoder / decoder with position comparison and correct handling of illegal transition states. With this in mind, and the very limited address space to use since I want to be able to set compare values, read input, write output and record the current counts there are no spare registers to store the "last" value. Some working around is therefore needed, but this generates creativity.

### Basics of quadrature encoders

The essence of quadrature encoding is to record two inputs which are square waves, with phase offset by 90Â° - these are typically encoded as A and B channels with the inputs from optical, magnetic or mechanical switches. The combination of out-of-phase A and B channels allows transitions which are incremental or decremental to be identified thus making it possible to keep track of positions in the absence of an absolute encoder of some kind.

As an exammple:

```
A __####____####__
B ____####____####
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <- encoder value
```

Here the transition of A from 0 `_` to 1 `#` indicates one increment, the subsequent transition of B a second, and so on. If we have a two-bit value `BA` the legal values are 0, 1, 2, 3 with the legal transitions 0-1, 1-3, 3-2, 2-0 (where transitions are commutative.) A transition of e.g. 0-3 or 1-2 is therefore an error, as this is changing both bits at once, indicating that the direction is lost. I think this is called a _following error_ and would like to be caught.

In essence, recording the current state, and the coming state is sufficient to derive whether we increment or decrement the count. If the states are the same there is no transition and thus no change in the count value.

### Implementation

Requirements:

- capacity to set a position compare value which will trigger a generic interrupt (which can be handled by a sepatate handler) then pull the _next_ position compare value
- only perform position compare interrupt triggering when the encoder count has changed
- trap following errors i.e. transitions from one state to another which miss an intermediate state.

Pin assignment: most of this program works by using the GPIO pins as a buffer - a total of five pins are used, two for the A, B inputs, two as a buffer for the old A and B values when reading in a new value (whicih are buffered by means of a side-set) then a fifth which is used to indicate that a following error has occurred.

```python
@rp2.asm_pio(
    set_init=(rp2.PIO.OUT_LOW,), sideset_init=(rp2.PIO.OUT_LOW, rp2.PIO.OUT_LOW)
)
def quad():
    # jump table encoding the actions which are to happen on the transition of
    # A, B (the previous) values to A', B' (the new values) - the transition
    # consisting of the previous and next state is encoded as a 4 bit value, BAB'A'
    # N.B. the order of blocks is therefore inconsistent with the order of count
    # values as we are using the program counter here to define the correct transtion.
    # N.B. also the first instruction here must be at position 0 => the program is 32
    # instructions long so <shrug>. The side-set values here record the values
    # of B'A' for the next cycle, and the side-set pins must occur on the two GPIOs
    # above the A and B inputs.

    # current 00

    jmp("out").side(0)
    jmp("inc").side(1)
    jmp("dec").side(2)
    jmp("err").side(3)

    # current 01

    jmp("dec").side(0)
    jmp("out").side(1)
    jmp("err").side(2)
    jmp("inc").side(3)

    # current 10

    jmp("inc").side(0)
    jmp("err").side(1)
    jmp("out").side(2)
    jmp("dec").side(3)

    # current 11

    jmp("err").side(0)
    jmp("dec").side(1)
    jmp("inc").side(2)
    jmp("out").side(3)

    # action 1: output the current count value - this is something of a nop
    # in many cases since the majority of 4-bit values read further down the
    # program will correspond to non-transitions - for the value to be "live"
    # a DMA or similar is needed to be constantly reading from the state
    # machine output FIFO

    # this also reads the values of four pins - the two side set pins and the two
    # input pins: this is read as a 4-bit integer and used to jmp to the correct
    # position in the jump table by writing the program counter (which is why the
    # jump table has to start from index 0)

    label("out")
    mov(isr, y)
    push(block)
    in_(pins, 4)
    mov(pc, isr)

    # decrement the counter - simply reduce y by 1, jump to the next position or
    # fall to it

    label("dec")
    jmp(y_dec, "ctd")
    label("ctd")
    jmp("cmp")

    # increment the counter: the PIO block has no mechanism to increment a register
    # value, but this can be emulated as three instructions by inverting y,
    # decrementing and then inverting the result - this falls through to the comparison

    label("inc")
    mov(y, invert(y))
    jmp(y_dec, "nxt")
    label("nxt")
    mov(y, invert(y))

    # position compare: if y != x then jump back to the out point and read in the
    # next transition, otherwise trigger an interrupt and block waiting for the next
    # position compare value (which we would hope would already be in the FIFO)

    label("cmp")
    jmp(x_not_y, "out")
    irq(0)
    pull(block)
    mov(x, osr)
    jmp("out")

    # error state: we have encountered an illegal transition so light the following
    # error light and continue: probably don't want to stop the program, since the
    # external program can decide what action to take on a rising LED

    label("err")
    set(pins, 1)
    jmp("out")

```
