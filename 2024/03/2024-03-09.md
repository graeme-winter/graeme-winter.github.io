# Teensy 4.1

Teensy 4.1 powered by i.MX RT1060 (ARM CORTEX M7). Get to know this, quite different to the M0+ / M4 I am used to.

## Interrupt handling, function speed etc.

Start with a little look at the performance from Python:

```python
from machine import Pin

led = Pin("D13", Pin.OUT)

while True:
    led.toggle()
```

Usually this is quite jittery, not so here:

CPU doing something useful then.

Interrupt performance:

```python
from machine import Pin

led = Pin("D13", Pin.OUT)

def irq(stuff):
    led.off()

led.irq(handler=irq, trigger=Pin.IRQ_RISING)

while True:
    led.on()
```

Also fairly solid:

Useful start - now look at C implementation of IRQ etc. - a smarter approach is to connect D13 to PWM, D14 as input and D15 as output so the delay can be measured directly:

```python
from machine import Pin, PWM

led = Pin("D13", Pin.OUT)
sense = Pin("D14", Pin.IN)
out = Pin("D15", Pin.OUT)

out.on()

@micropython.viper
def irq(stuff):
    out.toggle()

sense.irq(handler=irq, trigger=(Pin.IRQ_RISING | Pin.IRQ_FALLING))

pwm = PWM(led)

pwm.freq(1000)
pwm.duty_ns(10_000)
```

The delay appears to be a solid 1.72µs:

Switching out the `irq` call to:

```python
sense.irq(handler=irq, trigger=(Pin.IRQ_RISING | Pin.IRQ_FALLING), hard=True)
```

Makes for a small improvement (1.26µs) but still not in the regime where _real_ interrupts live.
