# Teensy 4.1

Teensy 4.1 powered by i.MX RT1060 (ARM CORTEX M7). Get to know this, quite different to the M0+ / M4 I am used to.

## Interrupt handling, function speed etc.

Start with a little look at the performance from Python:

```python
from machine import Pin

led = Pin("D13", Pin.OUT)

while True:
    led.toggle()
```

Usually this is quite jittery, not so here:

![Oscilloscope trace of toggle](./toggle.png)

CPU doing something useful then.

Interrupt performance:

```python
from machine import Pin

led = Pin("D13", Pin.OUT)

def irq(stuff):
    led.off()

led.irq(handler=irq, trigger=Pin.IRQ_RISING)

while True:
    led.on()
```

Also fairly solid:

Useful start - now look at C implementation of IRQ etc.
