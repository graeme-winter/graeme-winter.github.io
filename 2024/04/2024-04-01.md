# Basic Zephyr

Been meaning to look at [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) for a while and was nudged by reading [an article in Elektor magazine](https://www.elektormagazine.com/articles/getting-started-with-the-zephyr-rtos) to have a go. Had a BBC Micro:bit v1.3 lying around to play with which was handy.

Getting started easy enough, following instructions (had already done this for pico) but the magazine also talked about device trees which was something I had an interest in. Pulled a copy of the standard `blinky` example and added `pad2` as an ersatz LED for output:

```
/ {
    leds {
        compatible = "gpio-leds";
        led0: led_0 {
            gpios = <&gpio0 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
        };
    };

    aliases {
        led0 = &led0;
    };
};
```

This gets added as `boards/bbc_microbit.overlay` in the project source repo. Rather than building with `west` decided to figure out out-of-tree building: easy enough as it turns out:

```
BOARD=bbc_microbit cmake ..
make
```

Then

```
cp zephyr/zephyr.hex /Volumes/MICROBIT/
```

to flash the device. Code simple enough:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <zephyr/drivers/gpio.h>
#include <zephyr/kernel.h>

#define LED0_NODE DT_ALIAS(led0)

static const struct gpio_dt_spec led = GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET(LED0_NODE, gpios);

int main(void) {
  int ret;

  if (!gpio_is_ready_dt(&led)) {
    return 0;
  }

  ret = gpio_pin_configure_dt(&led, GPIO_OUTPUT_ACTIVE);
  if (ret < 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  while (1) {
    ret = gpio_pin_set_dt(&led,1);
    if (ret < 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    ret = gpio_pin_set_dt(&led,0);
    if (ret < 0) {
        return 0;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

which did indeed toggle the output:

but this seems very slow. Wondering if this is just the fact that the CPU is really slow, tried with basic register pokes:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <zephyr/drivers/gpio.h>
#include <zephyr/kernel.h>

#define LED0_NODE DT_ALIAS(led0)

static const struct gpio_dt_spec led = GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET(LED0_NODE, gpios);

int main(void) {
  int ret;

  volatile uint32_t *gpio_set = (uint32_t *)(0x50000000 | 0x508);
  volatile uint32_t *gpio_clr = (uint32_t *)(0x50000000 | 0x50c);

  if (!gpio_is_ready_dt(&led)) {
    return 0;
  }

  ret = gpio_pin_configure_dt(&led, GPIO_OUTPUT_ACTIVE);
  if (ret < 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  while (1) {
    *gpio_set = (0x1 << 1);
    *gpio_clr = (0x1 << 1);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

N.B. `volatile` here is critical: this worked correctly and was much faster:

The timing here is consistent with Cortex M0: load and store are two cycles, branch is three because three stage pipeline. Adding some `nop`s with `__asm__("nop")` can pad this nicely to give 1MHz-ish output with 8 cycles high and low.

Noteworthy things:

- device tree is easy enough, clean
- using Zephyr abstraction layers can be _very_ slow
- building with `cmake` and `make` probably easier in the long game

I expect for less trivial use cases this is probably worthwhile e.g. making USB devices and such.
